## Introduction

> CVRF-CSAF-converter is a Python tool for converting [CSAF CVRF 1.2 documents](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/cs01/csaf-cvrf-v1.2-cs01.html) in [CSAF 2.0 documents](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html). It fulfills the conformance target [CVRF CSAF converter](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#915-conformance-clause-5-cvrf-csaf-converter).

**Note**: The project is currently still under development. Not all features have been implemented and therefore the conformance goal is not yet fulfilled.

## Getting started

Assure that you have **Python 3** installed.

Assume your current directory is also avaliable at the environment variable `$ROOT_DIR`.

Check out the repository and navigate to the working directory.

```shell script
   git clone https://github.com/csaf-tools/CVRF-CSAF-Converter.git
   cd CVRF-CSAF-Converter
```

Afterwards, create a virtual environment and install the package there:

```shell script
   python3 -m venv venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   pip install .
```

_Hint: If you would like to get the debugger running, try to install the code as follows: `pip install -e .`_

## How to use CVRF-CSAF-converter

### Usage as CLI tool

To convert the CVRF CSAF 1.2 document `$ROOT_DIR/CVRF-CSAF-Converter/examples/1.2/cvrf_example_a.xml` use the following command:

```shell script
   cvrf2csaf --input-file $ROOT_DIR/CVRF-CSAF-Converter/examples/1.2/cvrf_example_a.xml
```

The default output directory is `./`, it can be set using `--output-dir`. 

The output filename is derived from the CSAF field `/document/tracking/id`.

If there is an ERROR during conversion, the output file will not be written unless `--force` option is used.

The rest of the options can be shown with:

```shell script
   cvrf2csaf -h
```

### Config

The [config file](https://github.com/csaf-tools/CVRF-CSAF-Converter/blob/main/cvrf2csaf/config/config.yaml) is installed inside the Python package (`.../site-packages/cvrf2csaf/config/config.yaml`).
Convertor options can be changed there, or overridden by command line arguments/options.

## Specifications

We follow the official OASIS specifications in order to provide as much acceptance on the user base as possible.

### Security Considerations

These are the TOP OWASP categories of vulnerabilities which potentially affect the CVRF-CSAF-Converter.
We are omitting those which do not apply (most of them), since it's a plain command-line tool (e.g. authentication failures)

#### [A03:2021 â€“ Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
The XML input for the converter is strictly validated for CVRF. The converter rejects invalid inputs.

However, there is a known issue for inserting HTML with code/script, which could be executed by a CSAF consumer: 
[Encode HTML in JSON output](https://github.com/csaf-tools/CVRF-CSAF-Converter/issues/5)

#### [A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
An automated SAST scanning tool like Github Dependabot can be used to scan the libraries for vulnerabilities.
Especially the `lxml` library can be susceptible.

#### [A4:2017 - XML External Entities (XXE)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
XXE vulnerability present in releases <1.0.0rc2 was fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/csaf-tools/CVRF-CSAF-Converter/commit/ff20a6c00245b064ceb6840dab0cd95a82fbec49)

## Project

CVRF-CSAF-Converter is a project between Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH and the Federal Office for Information Security. It aims to provide a CVRF 1.x to CSAF 2.0 converter.

Realization is taking place 100% Open Source. The final delivery will be in Q1/2022.
