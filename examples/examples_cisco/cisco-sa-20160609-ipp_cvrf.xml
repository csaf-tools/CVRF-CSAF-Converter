    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web application for Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to check the bounds of input data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP  request to the web server of a targeted device. A successful exploit  could allow the attacker to remotely execute  code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone,  resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they have web access enabled and are running a firmware release earlier than the first fixed release for that device:

IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, and 7861 Desktop Phones
IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8845, 8851, 8861, and 8865 Desktop Phones
Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX

Note: Web access is disabled by default. Administrators can check the web access configuration from Cisco Unified Communications Manager by choosing Device &gt; Phone &gt; Select a Phone and checking whether Web Access is set to Enabled or Disabled. If it is set to Disabled, the IP phone is not vulnerable.

For information about which Cisco firmware releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

However, if web access is not required, disabling it is considered a mitigation for this vulnerability. If web access is disabled, the phone is not vulnerable. For additional information, see the Web Access Disable chapter of the Phone Hardening ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/security/11_0_1/secugd/CUCM_BK_C1A78C1D_00_cucm-security-guide-1101/phone_hardening.pdf"] guide.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed firmware release as indicated in the following table:
        Cisco IP Phone Model  Cisco Bug ID  First Fixed Release          IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, 7861 Desktop Phones  CSCuz03034  ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz03034"]  11.7(1)      IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8845, 8851, 8861, 8865 Desktop Phones  CSCuz03034  ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz03034"]  11.7(1)      Wireless IP Phone 8821, 8821-EX  CSCvs78281 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvs78281"]  11.0(5)SR3
