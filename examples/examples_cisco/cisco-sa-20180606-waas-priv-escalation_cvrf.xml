    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco-provided scripts (disk-check.sh and harcap.sh) for Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate their privilege level to root. The attacker must have valid user credentials with super user privileges (level 15) to log in to the device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of script files executed in the context of the Cisco-provided scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replacing one script file with a malicious script file while an affected Cisco-provided script is running. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the device.


There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The WAAS Disk Check Tool (disk-check.sh) has been removed from Cisco.com and is no longer available for download. However, the tool could still be used to elevate privileges on devices running WAAS Software that do not yet have the fix for this vulnerability by attackers who downloaded the tool previously.

The harcap.sh script ships with WAAS Software Releases 5.5 and later by default. In releases that contain the fix for this vulnerability, the script can no longer be executed.

The fix for this vulnerability significantly changes the script signing and validation methodology in WAAS Software. As a result of this change, any scripts that were signed using the previous method will no longer run in WAAS releases that include the fix for this vulnerability.

Signed scripts are typically provided to address a specific problem for a limited set of releases only, so we generally do not expect previous scripts to still be required after upgrade. In a situation where they still apply after the upgrade to a release addressing this vulnerability, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to get their scripts updated.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
