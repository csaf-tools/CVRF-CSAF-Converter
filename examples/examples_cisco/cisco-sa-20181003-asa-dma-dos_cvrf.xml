    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the cryptographic hardware accelerator driver of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected devices have a limited amount of Direct Memory Access (DMA) memory and the affected software improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained, high rate of malicious traffic to an affected device to exhaust memory on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the affected device, which could cause the device to reload and result in a temporary DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software:

ASA 5506-X with FirePOWER Services
ASA 5506H-X with FirePOWER Services
ASA 5506W-X with FirePOWER Services
ASA 5508-X with FirePOWER Services
ASA 5516-X with FirePOWER Services

This vulnerability also affects the preceding products if FirePOWER Services are not installed or enabled.

For information about which Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine the Cisco ASA Software Release
To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):


ciscoasa# show version | include Version
  Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .

If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM log in window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.
Determine the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version
  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------</cvrf:Note>

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerability described in this advisory exists because the affected devices have a limited amount of DMA memory and the affected software improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. When the affected software cannot allocate DMA memory, the software may cause a device to crash and reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.

To address this vulnerability, Cisco corrected how the software handles resources in low-memory conditions. Cisco also implemented a DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED protocol stack counter that administrators can use to determine whether and how many DMA memory allocation failures have occurred on a device. Sustained periods of DMA memory allocation failures could adversely impact traffic that is sent through a device.

To check the value of the DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED counter, administrators can use the show counters privileged EXEC command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:


ciscoasa# show counters
  Protocol     Counter                                       Value   Context
.
.
.
CRYPTO       DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED                              1   Summary

If the value of the DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED counter increases quickly for a sustained period of time, administrators should contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for further investigation.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
