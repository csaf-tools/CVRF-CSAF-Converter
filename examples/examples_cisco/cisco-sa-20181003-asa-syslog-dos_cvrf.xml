    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the TCP syslog module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the 1550-byte buffers on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a missing boundary check in an internal function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an affected device and its configured TCP syslog server and then maliciously modifying the TCP header in segments that are sent from the syslog server to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust buffer on the affected device and cause all TCP-based features to stop functioning, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected TCP-based features include AnyConnect SSL VPN, clientless SSL VPN, and management connections such as Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, and HTTPS.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.
  Determine the Cisco ASA Software Release
To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):


ciscoasa# show version | include Version
  Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .

If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM log in window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.
Determine the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version
  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------</cvrf:Note>
