    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Aironet 1560, 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points (APs) software could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition that may occur when an affected AP attempts to dequeue aggregated traffic that is destined to an attacker-controlled wireless client. An attacker who can successfully transition between multiple Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) hosted on the same AP while replicating the required traffic patterns could trigger the deadlock condition. A watchdog timer that detects the condition will trigger a reload of the device, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-aironet-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-aironet-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects only Cisco 1560, 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Mobility Express (ME) Software. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

Determining the Cisco Mobility Express Software Release
To determine which Cisco Mobility Express Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the web interface or the CLI of the device.

To use the web interface, do the following:

Log in to the web interface
Choose System Software &gt; Software Upgrade
Refer to the value in the System Software Version field

To use the CLI, log in to the AP through a Telnet or an SSH session, issue the show version command, and then refer to the command output. The following example shows the command output for a Cisco Aironet 1852i Access Point that is running Cisco Mobility Express Software Release 8.3.111.0:


AP# show version
  cisco AIR-AP1852I-UXK9 ARMv7 Processor rev 0 (v71) with 997184/525160K bytes of memory.    Processor board ID RFDP2BCR021  AP Running Image : 8.3.111.0  Primary Boot Image : 8.3.111.0  Backup Boot Image : 8.1.106.33  AP Image type : MOBILITY EXPRESS IMAGE  AP Configuration : MOBILITY EXPRESS CAPABLE  .  .  .</cvrf:Note>
