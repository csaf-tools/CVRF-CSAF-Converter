    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On November 5, 2018, the Apache Struts Team released a security announcement urging an upgrade of the Commons FileUpload library to version 1.3.3 on systems using Struts 2.3.36 or earlier releases. Systems using earlier versions of this library may be exposed to attacks that could allow execution of arbitrary code or modifications of files on the system. The issue is caused by a previously reported vulnerability of the Apache Commons FileUpload library, assigned to CVE-2016-1000031.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted data to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate files on the targeted system.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-struts-commons-fileupload ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-struts-commons-fileupload"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by this vulnerability.

The Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product or service. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

Any product or service not listed in the “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following table lists Cisco products and services that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. The software availability dates in the Fixed Release Availability column are estimates, and actual software availability may differ from the dates provided in the following table.

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/ns/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/vuln">
    <Title>Apache Struts commons-fileupload Library DiskFileItem File Manipulation Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Apache Struts and the DiskFileItem class in the Apache Commons FileUpload library could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or modify arbitrary files on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted data to an affected system. A successful exploit could cause the deserialization of untrusted data, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate files on the targeted system.
