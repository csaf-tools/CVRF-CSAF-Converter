    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the web-based management interface of an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web-based management interface to become unreachable, resulting in a DoS condition.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
