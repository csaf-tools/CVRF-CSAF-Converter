    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to improper access controls for URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via HTTP or HTTPS and requesting specific URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download the router configuration or detailed diagnostic information.

Update, April 4, 2019: The initial fix for this vulnerability was found to be incomplete. The complete fix is now available in Firmware Release 1.4.2.22.

Firmware updates that address this vulnerability are currently available. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running Firmware Releases 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
  If the Remote Management feature is enabled, Cisco recommends disabling it to reduce exposure. The  feature setting is under Firewall &gt; General and is disabled by default. This will disable the web-based management interface on the WAN IP address, which is reachable via the WAN ports. The web-based management interface will continue to be available on the LAN IP address, which is reachable via the LAN ports.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

This vulnerability is fixed in RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN  Routers Firmware Release 1.4.2.22 and later.

  Customers can download the software from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

      Click Browse all.
Navigate to Routers &gt; Small Business Routers &gt; Small Business RV Series Routers &gt; RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router or RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router &gt; Small Business Router Firmware.
Access releases by using the left pane of the RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router or RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router page.</cvrf:Note>
