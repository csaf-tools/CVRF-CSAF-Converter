    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the cluster service manager of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute commands as the root user.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the cluster service manager and injecting commands into the bound process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands on the affected host as the root user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-hyperflex-injection ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-hyperflex-injection"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco HyperFlex Software releases prior to 3.5(2g).
  Determining the HyperFlex Software Release
To determine the installed release of Cisco HyperFlex Software, an administrator may use either the CLI or the GUI.

Using the CLI, the administrator can issue the stcli about command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco HyperFlex Software Release 3.0(1d):


root@hxcluster:~# stcli about
serviceType: stMgr  instanceUuid: c4f0441c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  name: HyperFlex StorageController  locale: English (United States)  serialNumber: WZP#####OCD,WZP#####OG9,WZP########  apiVersion: 0.1  modelNumber: HX240C-M5L  build: 3.0.1d-29754 (internal)  displayVersion: 3.0(1d)  fullName:  HyperFlex StorageController 3.0.1d  productVersion: 3.0.1d-29754

Using the GUI, the administrator can click the About link at the bottom left of the page after logging in to HX Connect.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A workaround for this vulnerability is available for customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed release. To coordinate implementation of the workaround, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) ["https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex 3.5(2g).

Customers can download software updates from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all.
Navigate to Hyperconverged Infrastructure &gt; HyperFlex HX Data Platform.
Access releases by using the left pane of the HyperFlex HX Data Platform page.</cvrf:Note>
