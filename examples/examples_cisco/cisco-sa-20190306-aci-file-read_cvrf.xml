    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches running in Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read arbitrary files on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms of user-supplied input sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker unauthorized access to read arbitrary files on an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-aci-file-read ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-aci-file-read"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode when they are running an affected release of Cisco NX-OS Software.

For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release
Administrators can determine the release of Cisco NX-OS Software running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example identifies the 11.2(2) Release:


nxos-n9k-aci# show version
Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software  such license is available at  http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php and http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.php  Software  BIOS:      version N/A  kickstart: version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]  system:    version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]  .  .  .
    Determining the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Software Release
There is a one-to-one mapping between the software for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode. To determine which Cisco APIC Software release is running on a device, administrators can disregard the leftmost digit of the Cisco NX-OS Software version number. In the preceding example, the output shows Cisco NX-OS Software version 11.2(2), which maps to Cisco APIC Software Release 1.2(2).</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.
