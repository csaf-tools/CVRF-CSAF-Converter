    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the management interface of Cisco Application  Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an  unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain unauthorized access on an  affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper  access control mechanisms for IPv6 link-local connectivity imposed on  the management interface of an affected device. An attacker on the same physical network could  exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the IPv6  link-local address on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  bypass default access control restrictions on an affected device.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
