    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the filesystem permissions of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive data that could be used to elevate their privileges to administrator.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of filesystem permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the CLI of an affected device, accessing a specific file, and leveraging this information to authenticate to the NX-API server. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to make configuration changes as administrator.

Note: NX-API is disabled by default.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
Nexus 3600 Platform Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules

For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release
Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.0(3)I5(1):

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerability affects only devices running Cisco NX-OS Software that are configured with the NX-API feature enabled.
To determine whether a device running Cisco NX-OS Software is configured with NX-API enabled, administrators can use the show feature | include nxapi command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that it is enabled. The following example shows the NX-API feature enabled on a device running Cisco NX-OS Software:




 nxos-switch# show feature | include nxapi
nxapi                1        enabled</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases

Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, customers should consider that this advisory is part of a bundled publication. The following page provides a complete list of bundle advisories: Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757"].

In the following tables, the left column lists releases of Cisco FXOS Software or Cisco NX-OS Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.



Although the releases listed in the right column of each table include fixes for the vulnerabilities, the fix related to the Cisco NX-OS Software Image Signature Verification Vulnerability ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif"] requires a BIOS upgrade as part of the software upgrade. Customers who are upgrading the software for any of the following products are advised to refer to this advisory for further details about the BIOS upgrade and affected product IDs and BIOS versions:

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode

    <Title>Cisco NX-OS Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCvk70659</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the filesystem permissions of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive data that could be used to elevate their privileges to administrator.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of filesystem permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the CLI of an affected device, accessing a specific file, and leveraging this information to authenticate to the NX-API server. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to make configuration changes as administrator.

Note: NX-API is disabled by default.
