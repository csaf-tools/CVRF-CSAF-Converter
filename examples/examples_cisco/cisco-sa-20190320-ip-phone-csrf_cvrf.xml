  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has  released free software updates that address the vulnerability described  in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for  software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a  license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such  software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco  software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they  have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco  authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance  upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security  software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license,  additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to  regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available  from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded  contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the  new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to  contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted  maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts


Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco  service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party  vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their  point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be  prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement  to a free upgrade.
