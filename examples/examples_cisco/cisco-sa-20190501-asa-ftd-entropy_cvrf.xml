    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also  known as Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), used in Cisco Adaptive  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a  cryptographic collision, enabling the attacker to discover the private  key of an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to  insufficient entropy in the DRBG when generating cryptographic keys. An  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number  of cryptographic keys on an affected device and looking for collisions  with target devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt  traffic secured by  an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-entropy ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-entropy"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software Releases 9.8 or 9.9 or FTD Software Releases 6.2.1, 6.2.2, or 6.2.3:

Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release
To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:


ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .

If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.
  Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version
  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------</cvrf:Note>

    <Title>Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Low Entropy Keys Vulnerability</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCvj52266</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also
known as Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), used in Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
(FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
cryptographic collision, enabling the attacker to discover the private
key of an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to
insufficient entropy in the DRBG when generating cryptographic keys. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number
of cryptographic keys on an affected device and looking for collisions
with target devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt  traffic secured by
an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.</Note>

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>To avoid the use of potentially weak cryptographic keys, administrators can generate a key pair and a corresponding certificate on a trusted device outside of the Cisco ASA or FTD device and then import the base 64 encoded PKCS #12 file containing the keys and certificate(s) to the Cisco ASA or FTD device using the crypto ca import &lt;trust-point-name&gt; pkcs12 &lt;passphrase&gt; command in global configuration mode.
