    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the remote access VPN session manager of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow a unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the remote access VPN services.

The vulnerability is due to an issue with the remote access VPN session manager. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting an excessive number of remote access VPN sessions. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-vpn-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-vpn-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software. For information about affected software releases, consult the tables in the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

The following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability if configured for multi-context:

3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)
ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls
ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
Firepower 2100 Series
Firepower 4100 Series
Firepower 9300 Security Appliances
  Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release
To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:


ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .

If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.
  Determining the Cisco ASA Configuration
To determine whether the ASA is configured in multi-context mode, administrators can use the show context command. The following display is sample output from the show context command, and shows three contexts:




hostname# show context
Context Name      Interfaces                    URL


*admin            GigabitEthernet0/1.100        disk0:/admin.cfg


                  GigabitEthernet0/1.101


contexta          GigabitEthernet0/1.200        disk0:/contexta.cfg


                  GigabitEthernet0/1.201


contextb          GigabitEthernet0/1.300        disk0:/contextb.cfg


                  GigabitEthernet0/1.301


Total active Security Contexts: 3


To determine whether the ASA is configured for remote-access VPN, administrators can use the show running-config command and check for the commands  tunnel-group &lt;tunnel_group_name&gt; type remote-access.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The condition is triggered when users are challenged for a PIN or new password after the initial username/password authentication and the user fails to provide this information within five minutes. During this time, the ASA allocates a temporary license from a pool defined by the platform. When the time out expires, the ASA fails to delete the sessionâ€™s temporary license. When all temporary licenses have been allocated, no additional connections are allowed.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Customers can use the following command on the affected device to temporarily clear the condition or reboot the device:


vpn-sessiondb logoff all</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party  vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to  upgrade to an appropriate release  ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
