  Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version
  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:

Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an adjacent or remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Low System Memory Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to run low on system memory, which may cause the device to stop forwarding traffic. A manual reload of the device may be required to clear the condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect SMB ingress packet processing for specific SMB packet types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted SMB packets to the targeted device from the local subnet. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to run low on system memory, which could prevent the Snort process from forwarding traffic. This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6 with either SMB Version 2 (SMBv2) or SMB Version 3 (SMBv3) network traffic.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1696

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: High

Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort process to unexpectedly restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect SMB ingress packet processing for specific SMB packet types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB connection to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to crash.  This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6 with either SMBv2 or SMBv3 network traffic.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1704

The SIR for this vulnerability is: High</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Low System Memory Denial of Service Vulnerability could cause the device to run low on system memory, which could cause the Snort process to restart unexpectedly. If the following error log is observed, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to determine whether the vulnerability has been exploited on the device.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To ensure a complete upgrade solution, customers should consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
