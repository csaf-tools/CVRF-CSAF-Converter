    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the WebVPN login process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for existing WebVPN login operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN login requests to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software when configured for WebVPN:

    3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)
    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 1000V Cloud Firewall
    ASA 5505 Series Adaptive Security Appliance1
    ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls
    ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
    Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
    Firepower 2100 Series
    Firepower 4100 Series
    Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module
    Firepower Threat Defense Virtual

1ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances other than the ASA 5505 have reached the end-of-support milestone and are no longer evaluated for security vulnerabilities.

For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determining If WebVPN Is Enabled
To determine if the WebVPN service is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show running-config webvpn privileged EXEC command and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the WebVPN service enabled:


ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn


.
.  .  webvpn  enable interface_name  .  .  .

    Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release
To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:


ciscoasa# show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .

If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.
  Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release
To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:


&gt; show version
  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">During active exploitation of this vulnerability, administrators may notice increased CPU usage by the Unicorn Proxy Thread process. This can be checked by issuing the show processes cpu-usage non-zero command at the CLI and reviewing the statistics for the Unicorn Proxy Thread process.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

It is possible that during active exploitation an administrator could mitigate the attack by implementing an ACL to block the incoming requests or perform rate-limiting.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To ensure a complete upgrade solution, customers should consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
