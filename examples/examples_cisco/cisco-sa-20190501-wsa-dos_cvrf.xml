    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of HTTP and HTTPS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP or HTTPS request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart of the web proxy process, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-wsa-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-wsa-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software  for Cisco Web Security Appliance,  both virtual and hardware appliances. For more information about which Cisco AsyncOS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware appliances
Security Management Appliance (SMA), both virtual and hardware appliances</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Upon successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the WSA could write out a core file for  the main proxy process. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to  review the core file and confirm if the core file shows that the device  has been compromised by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:
                                 Cisco AsyncOS Software Major Release               First Fixed Release                                               10.1               Not vulnerable
                                   10.5               Not vulnerable
                                   11.5               11.5.2-020                                   11.7               11.7.0-406
In most  cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System  Upgrade options in the web interface of the WSA. To upgrade a device by  using the web interface:

Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.
Click Upgrade Options.
Choose Download and Install.
Choose the release to upgrade to.
In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.
Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.</cvrf:Note>
