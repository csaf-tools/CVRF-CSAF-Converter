    <cvrf:IssuingAuthority>Cisco product security incident response is the responsibility of the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT). The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of security vulnerability information that is related to Cisco products and networks. The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24x7 with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security issues with Cisco products and networks.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

These vulnerabilities exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-sqlinject ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-sqlinject"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco PI Software Releases prior to 3.4.1, 3.5, and 3.6, and EPN Manager Releases prior to 3.0.1.
  Determining the PI Software Release
The administrator can view the PI software release in three ways:

The administrator can issue the show version command from the console CLI. The following output is from an affected application that is running PI Software Release 3.3.0:

piconsole# show version
Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 3.1
ADE-OS Build Version: 3.1.0.001
ADE-OS System Architecture: x86_64

Version information of installed applications
---------------------------------------------

Cisco Prime Infrastructure
********************************************************
Version : 3.3.0
Build : 3.3.0.0.342


The administrator can view the PI release and maintenance release updates by connecting to the web interface using the http(s)://&lt;system-ip&gt;      access URL. The PI software release is displayed on the welcome screen.      The following is an example of text that is displayed in the pop-up      window for PI Software Release 3.3:

Cisco Prime Infrastructure
Version 3.3
View Installed Update

The administrator can also view the PI release and maintenance releases by logging in to the web interface using the http(s)://&lt;system-ip&gt; access URL and choosing Gear &gt; About Prime Infrastructure.
  Determining the EPN Manager Software Release
The administrator can log in to the web GUI to view the software updates in three ways:

Click the View Installed Updates link on the login page.
Access the View Installed Updates link from the About Cisco EPN Manager page:


Click the settings icon at the top right of the page.
Click About Cisco EPN Manager.
Click View Installed Updates.

Choose Administration &gt; Licenses and Software Updates &gt; Software Update in the EPN Manager. (This method provides the most detail.)

The Software Update page displays two tabs:

Installed Updates: Updates that Cisco EPN Manager is currently using.
Uploaded Update Files: Update files that have been uploaded to the server (including those that are not being used). The Corresponding Updates field      lists any prerequisite updates that were also uploaded.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
These vulnerabilities are fixed in Cisco PI Software Releases 3.4.1, 3.5, and 3.6, and EPN Manager Release 3.0.1.

Note: Customers running releases of Cisco PI 3.4  must apply the Security Update to the latest maintenance release, PI  3.4.1, to patch these vulnerabilities for PI 3.4.

Note: Customers running releases of Cisco PI 3.5 must apply the Security Update to PI 3.5.

Customers can download the Cisco PI Software from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all.
Choose Cloud and Systems Management &gt; Routing and Switching Management &gt; Network Management Solutions &gt; Prime Infrastructure.

Customers can download the Cisco EPN Manager Software from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all.
Choose Cloud and Systems Management &gt; Routing and Switching Management &gt; Evolved Programmable Network Manager.</cvrf:Note>
