    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. No exploit code proving exploitability of the vulnerabilities is publicly available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-webex-player ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-webex-player"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:

Cisco Webex Business Suite sites — All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS39.2.205
Cisco Webex Meetings Online — All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version 1.3.42

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Mac OS is not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Webex Business Suite services and Cisco Webex Meetings Online are hosted, multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.

Cisco Webex Business Suite services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.

The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from the Cisco Webex website ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"], from the user's Webex site, or automatically when a user accesses an ARF file for streaming playback from a Cisco Webex Business Suite site.

The Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can also be installed manually from the Cisco Webex website ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] or from the user's Webex site.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, customers may remove the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player from a system by using the software-removal procedure for the operating system. For example, to remove a player from a Microsoft Windows 10 system, customers can use the Apps &amp; Features app in Windows Settings.

To remove all Cisco Webex software from a Microsoft Windows system, customers can use the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article Cisco Webex and 3rd Party Support Utilities ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396"].

By removing the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player, a user will be unable to play recordings. However, the next time media is accessed, the system will download a new version of the software, providing the user with an updated version.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases  Cisco has fixed these vulnerabilities in the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player:
      Cisco Webex Business Suite sites — Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS39.2.205 and later
Cisco Webex Business Suite lockdown sites — Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS33.6.11 and later
      Cisco Webex Meetings Online — Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions 1.3.42 and later
      Cisco Webex Meetings Server — Webex Network Recording Player Versions 2.8MR3 SecurityPatch2, 3.0MR2 SecurityPatch3, or 4.0 and later

Cisco has not and will not fix all these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites because those sites have reached the end-of-version-support milestone. For information about this milestone and the upgrade plans for WBS32 sites, see Cisco Webex Meetings Suite Version Retirement Policy ["https://help.webex.com/en-us/ns12j0bb/Cisco-Webex-Meetings-Suite-Version-Retirement-Policy"].

Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player in either of two ways:

      Automatically: The player will be automatically upgraded to the latest version of the software when a user accesses an ARF file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Business Suite site, Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, or Cisco Webex Meetings Server.
      Manually: The player can be downloaded and installed from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].

Note: Customers who use locked-down Cisco Webex sites will not receive updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player automatically. These customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support to obtain updates or the latest version of the player from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].

Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Player by uninstalling their current version of the player and then downloading and installing the latest version of the player from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html ["https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].
