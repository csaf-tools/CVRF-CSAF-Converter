An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted system that contain references within XML entities. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.
