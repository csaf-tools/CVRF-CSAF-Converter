    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of Intermediate System–to–Intermediate System (IS–IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker who is in the same IS-IS area to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of IS–IS link-state protocol data units (PDUs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific link-state PDUs to an affected system to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause incorrect calculations used in the weighted remote shared risk link groups (SRLG) or in the IGP Flexible Algorithm. It could also cause tracebacks to the logs or potentially cause the receiving device to crash the IS–IS process, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1918 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1918"]

A companion advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1910 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis1-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running Cisco IOS XR Software releases later than 6.5.1 and earlier than 6.6.3.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.


  Determining Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration
  To determine if the device is configured for IS–IS routing, administrators can use the show running-config router isis EXEC command in the CLI. If the router is configured with IS–IS routing, it will return output. The following example shows the output of the show running-config router isis command on a device that is configured as a level 1 IS–IS router.

The device is affected if it is configured as one of the following: is-type level-1, level-1-2 or level-2-only.


RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:IOSXR#show running-config router isis
Sun May 26 05:20:23.088 UTC  router isis core  is-type level-1  net 49.0001.1921.6825.5091.00  address-family ipv4 unicast  !  interface TenGigE0/0/0/1    address-family ipv4 unicast   !
    For the device to be exploitable, it would need at least one formed IS–IS adjacency.

RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:IOSXR#show isis adjacency

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco recommends that customers ensure the authentication of routers within the IS–IS area for adjacency establishment (Hello packets) and for link-state PDUs when implementing IS–IS. If this best practice is followed, then only an authenticated adjacency within the same IS-IS area that sends the specific IS–IS link-state PDU could exploit this vulnerability.

Cisco also recommends that customers enable Non-Stop Forwarding and/or Non-Stop Routing.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, following Cisco best practices and ensuring that IS–IS authentication is enabled for adjacencies (Hello packets) and link-state PDUs would restrict this vulnerability to only authenticated link-state PDUs. For example:


router isis core
lsp-password hmac-md5 encrypted 13061E010803  interface TenGigE0/0/0/6    hello-password hmac-md5 encrypted 094F471A1A0A  !



For more information on IS–IS Authentication, see the IS–IS Authentication chapter ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/xr12000/software/xr12k_r4-0/routing/configuration/guide/rc40xr12k_chapter3.html#con_1276647"] of Implementing IS–IS on Cisco IOS XR Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
