    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the “plug-and-play” services component of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper access restrictions on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access running configuration information about devices managed by the IND, including administrative credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190904-ind ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190904-ind"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco IND releases earlier than Release 1.6.0 are affected when plug-and-play services are enabled. Plug-and-play services are not enabled by default.

To verify whether plug-and-play services are enabled, administrators can use the web-based management interface. Choose Design &gt; Plug and Play &gt; Profiles, and look for a plug-and-play profile under the serial number of the managed device. If a profile exists, plug-and-play services are enabled.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco IND can function as a plug-and-play server to deploy system-supported network devices with an initial configuration. To enable plug-and-play services, a network administrator must create a plug-and-play profile with the configuration template to be applied and the plug-and-play match criteria, including the device serial number and the optional software image(s). If an administrator does not create a plug-and-play profile on an IND, then the IND does not function as a plug-and-play server.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
 Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
 Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IND releases 1.6.0 and later.</cvrf:Note>
