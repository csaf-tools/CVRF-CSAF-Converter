    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the WebVPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device.
The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for a specific WebVPN HTTP page request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN HTTP page load requests for a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, which could cause traffic to be delayed through the device.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-dos ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-dos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco products running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software when configured for WebVPN.
  For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.  Determine If WebVPN Is Enabled
  To determine if the WebVPN service is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show running-config webvpn privileged EXEC command and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the WebVPN service enabled:


ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn
.
.
.
webvpn
enable interface_name
.
.
.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Firepower Management Center (FMC)
Firepower Management Center 1000</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">During active exploitation of this vulnerability, administrators may notice increased CPU usage by the Unicorn Proxy Thread process. This can be checked by issuing the show processes cpu-usage non-zero command at the CLI and reviewing the statistics for the Unicorn Proxy Thread process.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

It is possible that during active exploitation, an administrator could mitigate the attack by implementing an access control list (ACL) to block the incoming requests or perform rate limiting.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
