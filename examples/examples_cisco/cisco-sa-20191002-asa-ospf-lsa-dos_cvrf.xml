    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly parses certain options in OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

  This advisory is part of the October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 18 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72541"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that is configured to support OSPF routing.
  Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an ASA
To determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an ASA, administrators can use the show ospf privileged mode command. If no output is returned, OSPF routing is not configured. In the following example, the device is configured for OSPF routing:


asa# show ospf
  Routing Process “ospf 2” with ID 10.1.89.2 and Domain ID 0.0.0.2  Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes  Supports opaque LSA  .  .  .
    Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on FTD
To determine whether OSPF routing is configured on FTD, administrators can do one of the following:

For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), choose Devices &gt; Device Management, select the device of interest, and then choose  Routing &gt; OSPF. If either Process 1 or Process 2 has a check mark, OSPF is enabled on the device.
For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), choose Device  &gt; Advanced Configuration &gt; View Configuration &gt; Smart CLI  &gt; Routing. If there is an object with the type of OSPF, then OSPF is enabled on the device.

For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco FMC Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
