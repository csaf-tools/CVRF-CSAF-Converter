    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition that prevents the creation of new SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections to an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of Base64-encoded strings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening many SSL VPN sessions to an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials on the affected device to exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite a special system memory location, which will eventually result in memory allocation errors for new SSL/TLS sessions to the device, preventing successful establishment of these sessions. A reload of the device is required to recover from this condition. Established SSL/TLS connections to the device and SSL/TLS connections through the device are not affected.

Note: Although this vulnerability is in the SSL VPN feature, successful exploitation of this vulnerability would affect all new SSL/TLS sessions to the device, including management sessions.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

  This advisory is part of the October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 18 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72541"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software and that have either the Clientless SSL VPN or AnyConnect SSL VPN enabled.

For information about which Cisco ASA Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine Whether an SSL VPN Is Configured
Administrators can use the show running-config webvpn command to determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN or AnyConnect SSL VPN is enabled. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the Clientless SSL VPN or AnyConnect SSL VPN enabled:


ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn
webvpn  .  .  .   enable &lt;interface_name&gt;  .  .  .</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.
  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
