    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page.

This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
