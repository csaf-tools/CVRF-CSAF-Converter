    <cvrf:IssuingAuthority>Cisco product security incident response is the responsibility of the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT). The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of security vulnerability information that is related to Cisco products and networks. The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24x7 with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security issues with Cisco products and networks.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco firmware for certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers is affected by the following issues:

Certificate and key issued to QNO Technology
Hardcoded password hashes
Multiple vulnerabilities in third-party software (TPS) components
  Certificate and Key Issued to QNO Technology

An X.509 certificate with a corresponding public/private key pair was initially found in Cisco RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router firmware. This certificate is issued to third-party entity QNO Technology.

The certificate and keys in question are part of the firmware for the following Cisco products:

RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router
RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router
RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router
RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router

The certificate and keys were used for testing during the development of the firmware; they were never used for live functionality in any shipping version of the product. All shipping versions of the firmware for the affected products use dynamically created certificates instead.

The inclusion of this certificate and keys in shipping software was an oversight by the development team for these routers.

Cisco bug ID: CSCvq34370 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq34370"]

  Hardcoded Password Hashes

The /etc/shadow file included in Cisco firmware for the following Cisco products contains hardcoded password hashes for the users root, cisco, and lldpd.

RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router
RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router
RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router
RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router

The /etc/shadow file is not consulted during user authentication by the firmware. Instead, a dedicated alternate user database is used to authenticate users who log in to the web-based management interface of the affected routers.

An attacker with access to the base operating system on an affected device could exploit this issue to obtain elevated privileges at the level of the root, cisco, or lldpd user. However, Cisco is not currently aware of a way to access the base operating system on these routers.

Cisco bug ID: CSCvq34376 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq34376"]

  Multiple Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Software Components
Third-party software (TPS) components in the firmware for the following products contain vulnerabilities:

RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router
RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router
RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router
RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router

Cisco will handle these vulnerabilities by using the regular Cisco process for TPS vulnerabilities in accordance with the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#3psv"]. For information about known TPS vulnerabilities that affect the firmware for these routers, consult the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These issues affect the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers when they are running a firmware release earlier than 4.2.3.10:

RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router1
RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router
RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router
RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router1

1. The Cisco RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router and RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router have reached the end of software maintenance.
  Products Confirmed Not Affected
Only products listed in the Affected Products ["#ap"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these issues.
  Updated Firmware
Cisco removed the static certificates and keys as well as the hardcoded password hashes in firmware releases 4.2.3.10 and later for the Cisco RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router and RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router.

Customers can download the firmware from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all.
Choose Routers &gt; Small Business Routers &gt; Small Business RV Series Routers.
Choose a specific product from the right pane of the product selector.
Click Small Business Router Firmware.</cvrf:Note>
