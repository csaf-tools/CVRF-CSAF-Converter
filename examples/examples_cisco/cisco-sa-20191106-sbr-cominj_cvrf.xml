    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system. When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-sbr-cominj ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-sbr-cominj"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers are vulnerable if they are running a firmware release earlier than 4.2.3.10:

RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router1
RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router
RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router
RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router1

1. The Cisco RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router and RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router have reached the end of software maintenance.

The Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers are vulnerable if they are running a firmware release earlier than 1.5.1.05.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

However, administrators can reduce the attack surface by disabling the Remote Management feature if there is no operational requirement to use it. Note that the feature is disabled by default.

Administrators can disable the Remote Management feature by choosing Firewall &gt; General and unchecking the Remote Management check box. Disabling the feature will disable the web-based management interface on the WAN IP address, which is reachable through the WAN ports. The interface will still be available on the LAN IP address, which is reachable through the LAN ports.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the Cisco RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router and RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router firmware releases 4.2.3.10 and later.

Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers firmware releases 1.5.1.05 and later.

Customers can download the software from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:

Click Browse all.
Choose Routers &gt; Small Business Routers &gt; Small Business RV Series Routers.
Choose a specific product from the right pane of the product selector.
Click Small Business Router Firmware.</cvrf:Note>
