  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrative privileges on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication responses from an external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based management interface of the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-fmc-auth ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-fmc-auth"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco FMC Software if it is configured to authenticate users of the web-based management interface through an external LDAP server.

For information about which Cisco FMC Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine Whether External Authentication Through LDAP Is Enabled
To determine whether external authentication using an LDAP server is configured on the device, administrators can navigate to System &gt; Users &gt; External Authentication and look for an External Authentication Object that uses LDAP as the authentication method. The External Authentication Object must be enabled for the FMC to be affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, customers who cannot immediately apply a software fix may evaluate the possibility of disabling LDAP authentication for FMC access and using other authentication methods until a software fix can be applied.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

  1. Cisco FMC Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
2. Customers who are running a 6.2.0, 6.2.1, or 6.2.2 release should migrate either to a release that integrates the fix or to a release for which a hotfix patch is available. For example, customers could migrate to Release 6.2.3 and then install the hotfix patch, which is Sourcefire_3D_Defense_Center_S3_Hotfix_DO-6.2.3.16-3.sh.REL.tar.

3. Cisco FMC Software Release 6.5.0.1 integrates a fix for this vulnerability; however, it is no longer available for download.

Customers who are running the following Cisco FMC Software releases can remediate by doing the following:

      Releases earlier than 6.1.0: Migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfixes.
      6.1.0: Apply the hotfix listed in the preceding table or migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfix.
      6.2.0 through 6.2.2: Migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfix.
      6.2.3 or 6.3.0: Apply available hotfixes; maintenance releases will be available later this year.
      6.4.0: Apply available hotfixes or upgrade to Release 6.4.0.7.
      6.5.0: Upgrade to 6.5.0.2.

Customers may install a fix either by upgrading to a fixed release or by installing a hotfix patch. The availability of each option for all the supported software releases is documented in the preceding table.

To upgrade to a release that includes a fix for this vulnerability or to install a hotfix patch, customers are advised to follow the Cisco Firepower Management Center Upgrade Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/upgrade/fpmc-upgrade-guide.html"] and then review the appropriate release notes ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-release-notes-list.html"] or, if applicable, review the Firepower Hotfix Release Notes ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/hotfix/Firepower_Hotfix_Release_Notes.html"].</cvrf:Note>
