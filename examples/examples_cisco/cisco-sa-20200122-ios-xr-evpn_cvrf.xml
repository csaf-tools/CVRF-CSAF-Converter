    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.

The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-evpn ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-evpn"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software later than 6.6.1 and are configured for BGP on a device with the L2VPN EVPN address family. Some device EVPN configurations, such as the load-balancing-mode port-active configuration, can also cause devices to be vulnerable without specific L2VPN configurations.
  Determine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration
To determine whether the device is configured for BGP, administrators can use the show running-config router bgp EXEC command in the CLI. If the router is configured for BGP, this command will return output.

The following example shows the partial output of the show running-config router bgp command on a device that is configured for BGP:


# show running-config router bgp
router bgp 65536
.  .  .

To determine whether the device is configured for the EVPN address family, administrators can use the show running-config router bgp AS-Number address-family l2vpn evpn EXEC command in the CLI. If the router is configured for the BGP EVPN address family, this command will return output.

The following example shows the partial output of the show running-config router bgp AS-Number address-family l2vpn evpn command on a device with the EVPN address family configured:


# show running-config router bgp 65536 address-family l2vpn evpn
router bgp 100
address-family l2vpn evpn
.  .  .

To determine whether the device has the EVPN configuration, administrators can use the show running-config l2vpn and show running-config evpn EXEC commands in the CLI. If the device is a provider edge router for EVPN, this command will return output.

The following examples show the show running-config l2vpn  and show running-config evpn commands on a provider edge EVPN device:


# show running-config l2vpn
l2vpn
 bridge group &lt;bridge_group&gt;
  bridge-domain &lt;bridge_domain&gt;
.  .  .

   interface &lt;&gt;
   evi &lt;evi&gt;
   !
  !
!
.  .  .



# show running-config evpn
evpn
   interface &lt;interface&gt;

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a next-generation solution that provides Ethernet multipoint services over MPLS networks. Customers can learn more about EVPN and configuration options in guides such as the L2VPN and Ethernet Services Configuration Guide for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r7-0/lxvpn/configuration/guide/b-l2vpn-cg-asr9000-70x/b-l2vpn-cg-asr9000-70x_chapter_01011.html"] and in guides for other platforms that support this feature.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

    <Title>Cisco IOS XR Software BGP EVPN Multicast Denial of Service Vulnerabilities</Title>
    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCvr74413</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.

The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.
