    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of an internal file management service for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode that are running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files with root privileges on the device.

This vulnerability exists because TCP port 9075 is incorrectly configured to listen and respond to external connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to an IP address that is configured on a local interface on TCP port 9075. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files, including sensitive files that are related to the device configuration. For example, the attacker could add a user account without the device administrator knowing.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3000-9000-fileaction-QtLzDRy2 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3000-9000-fileaction-QtLzDRy2"]

This advisory is part of the February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74414"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 9.3(5) or Release 9.3(6):

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode

These devices are vulnerable by default.

To check a device, use the show sockets connection | include 9075 CLI command. If the command does not return output, the device is considered not vulnerable. If the command returns the following output, the device is considered vulnerable:


nexus# show sockets connection | include 9075
tcp LISTEN 0 32 * : 9075                  *:*


If the command returns output that matches the following, the device is considered not vulnerable because the fix has been applied:


nexus# show sockets connection | include 9075
tcp LISTEN 0 32 *%veobc:9075              *:*</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Firepower 1000 Series
Firepower 2100 Series

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to allow only strictly required management and control plane traffic that is destined to the affected device, as recommended in the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html"], would prevent remote exploitation of this vulnerability. Customers are advised to explicitly deny all TCP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address with a destination port of 9075 as part of their iACLs. A customized control plane policing (CoPP) policy may also be used to drop all TCP port 9075 traffic that is destined to an affected device.

Customers are advised to first evaluate the impact of configuration changes to the device and their security policy. Customers who are concerned about undesired or unexpected side effects are advised to contact their support organization before implementing  configuration changes.

In addition, local exploitation of this vulnerability is possible if the NX-OS features bash or guestshell are enabled. There is no workaround or mitigation for a local attacker with valid device credentials; however, customers are advised to follow best practices for account management as outlined in the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices - Use Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html#_Toc303633186"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Cisco NX-OS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).

Customers can use the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to search advisories in the following ways:

Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases
Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases
Enter the output of the show version command

After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.

Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:
    Cisco NX-OS Software  Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode    MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches  Nexus 1000V Series Switches  Nexus 3000 Series Switches  Nexus 5000 Series Switches  Nexus 6000 Series Switches  Nexus 7000 Series Switches  Nexus 9000 Series Switches




By default, the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.

Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches SMUs

For Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches, SMUs are available for Cisco NX-OS Software releases 9.3(5) and 9.3(6). Customers can download the following SMUs from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home"] on Cisco.com:
