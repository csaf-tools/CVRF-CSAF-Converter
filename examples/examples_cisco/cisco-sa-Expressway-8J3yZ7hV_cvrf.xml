    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server component of Cisco Expressway software supports the relay of media connections through a firewall using proxy services. As a result of this feature, interfaces such as the Cisco Expressway web administrative interface may become accessible from external networks.

At the time of publication, documentation of the feature did not properly explain that users are able to bypass firewall protections that are designed to restrict access to the Cisco Expressway web administrative interface. However, an attacker must have credentials sufficient to use TURN services to be able to send network requests to the web administrative interface.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This issue impacts Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) with the TURN server feature enabled.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected.

Cisco has confirmed that Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS systems that do not have the TURN server feature enabled are not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco Expressway IP Port Usage Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/config_guide/X12-6/Cisco-Expressway-IP-Port-Usage-for-Firewall-Traversal-Deployment-Guide-X12-6.pdf"] recommends firewall configuration to prevent access to administrative ports from external networks. However, when TURN services are enabled, administrative ports are accessible through the TURN server from external networks. Customers should be aware that enabling the TURN services exposes administrative ports on the Cisco Expressway Series or Cisco TelePresence VCS host.</cvrf:Note>
