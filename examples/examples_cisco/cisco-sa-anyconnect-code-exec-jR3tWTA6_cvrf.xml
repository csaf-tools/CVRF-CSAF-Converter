    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the install, uninstall, and upgrade processes of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to hijack DLL or executable files that are used by the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-code-exec-jR3tWTA6 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-code-exec-jR3tWTA6"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:

AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Mac OS
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for mobile device operating systems such as iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Uninstall Executable Hijacking Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the uninstall process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because a temporary file with insecure permissions is created during the uninstall process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by overwriting the temporary file before it is accessed for execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvv43102, CSCvv60844
CVE ID(s): CVE-2021-1426
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Upgrade DLL Hijacking Vulnerabilities

Two vulnerabilities in the upgrade process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack on an affected device.

These vulnerabilities exist because the application loads a DLL file from a user-writable directory. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by copying a malicious DLL file to a specific directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Upgrade Executable Hijacking Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the install process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because a temporary file with insecure permissions is created during the upgrade process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by overwriting the temporary file before it is accessed for execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Install Executable Hijacking Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the install process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because the application loads an executable file from a user-writable directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a malicious executable file to a specific directory, which would be executed when the application is installed or upgraded. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvu77671
CVE ID(s): CVE-2021-1496

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
 Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
