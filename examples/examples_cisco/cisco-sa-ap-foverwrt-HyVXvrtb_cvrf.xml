    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of a CLI command in Cisco Aironet Access Points (AP) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite files in the flash memory of the device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or create files with data that is already present in other files that are hosted on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
