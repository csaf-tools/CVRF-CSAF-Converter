    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On September 16, 2021, the Apache Software Foundation disclosed five vulnerabilities affecting the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.4.48 and earlier releases.

For a description of these vulnerabilities, see the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 section ["https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.49"] of the Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities webpage.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-httpd-2.4.49-VWL69sWQ ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-httpd-2.4.49-VWL69sWQ"]

A vulnerability in the mod_proxy module of Apache HTTP Server (httpd) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to make the httpd server forward requests to an arbitrary server.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of unix: URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to get, modify, or delete resources on other services that may be inaccessible otherwise.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products.

The Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section includes Cisco bug IDs for each product. The bugs will be accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and will contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

  Products Under Investigation
The following products are under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
  Cisco Cloud Hosted Services

Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.
