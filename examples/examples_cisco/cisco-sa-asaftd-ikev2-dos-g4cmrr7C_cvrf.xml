    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper control of a resource. An attacker with the ability to spoof a trusted IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer and in possession of valid IKEv2 credentials for that peer could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed, authenticated IKEv2 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ikev2-dos-g4cmrr7C ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ikev2-dos-g4cmrr7C"]

This advisory is part of the October 2021 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74773"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software and were configured with at least one IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine the IKEv2 Site-to-Site VPN Configuration
To determine whether an IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer is configured and enabled on the device, use the show running-config crypto CLI command and look for the presence of all of the following:

IKEv2 enabled on an interface
A crypto map specifying an IKEv2 proposal
The same crypto map in the same sequence number identifying a peer for the IPsec connection
The same crypto map enabled on an interface on which IKEv2 is enabled

The following example shows the output of the show running-config crypto command on a device that has IKEv2 enabled on the outside interface on which crypto map abcmap in sequence number 1 specifies IKEv2 proposal secure and IPsec peer 10.10.4.108 and on which crypto map abcmap is bound to the outside interface:


firewall# show running-config crypto
.
.
.
crypto ikev2 enable outside
.
.
.
crypto map abcmap 1 set peer 10.10.4.108
crypto map abcmap 1 set ikev2 ipsec-proposal secure
crypto map abcmap interface outside
.
.
.
firewall#

In this example, the device is vulnerable to authenticated IKEv2 messages with an IPv4 source address of 10.10.4.108 destined to the outside interface.</cvrf:Note>
