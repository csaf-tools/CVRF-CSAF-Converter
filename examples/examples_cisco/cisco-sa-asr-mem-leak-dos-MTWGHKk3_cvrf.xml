  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IPv4 protocol handling of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the available memory and cause an unexpected restart of the npusim process, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-mem-leak-dos-MTWGHKk3 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-mem-leak-dos-MTWGHKk3"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a release of Cisco StarOS earlier than Release 21.22.0 and had the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) feature enabled:

ASR 5000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
Virtualized Packet Coreâ€”Single Instance (VPC-SI)

The VPP feature is disabled by default.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine the VPP Configuration

To see if the VPP feature is enabled, use the show task table process vpp_main all command. If the command output lists the vpp_main process, the feature is enabled. The following is a sample output with the VPP feature enabled:


[local]swch# show task table process vpp_main all
        task                                             parent   cpu facility                 inst    pid pri node  facility      inst    pid  ----   ----------------------------------------------  -------------------------   1/0 vpp_main   1005729   5729   0  all  -                0      0</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
      Fixed Releases
At the time of publication, Cisco StarOS releases 21.22.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.
