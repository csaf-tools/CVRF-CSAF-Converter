    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts or gain elevated privileges on an affected system.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broadworks-dJ9JT67N ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broadworks-dJ9JT67N"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software releases earlier than a fixed release if they implemented user access control through the web-based management interface to restrict access for the read-only system administrator role.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-34785: Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges.

This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checks on operations in the affected application. An attacker with read-only system administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify an existing system administrator account and assume the privileges of the targeted account, resulting in privilege escalation.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
