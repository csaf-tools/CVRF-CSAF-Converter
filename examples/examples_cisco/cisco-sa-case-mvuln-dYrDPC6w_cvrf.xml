    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain privileged access to host-level operations or to learn device-specific information, create diagnostic files, and make limited configuration changes.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-case-mvuln-dYrDPC6w ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-case-mvuln-dYrDPC6w"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Application Services Engine Software releases 1.1(3d) and earlier.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1393: Cisco Application Services Engine Unauthorized Service Access Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a privileged service on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a service running in the Data Network. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP requests to a specific service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to have privileged access to run containers or invoke host-level operations.

Bug ID(s): CSCvw14124 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw14124"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1393
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Critical
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-1396: Cisco Application Services Engine Unauthorized API Access Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker access to a specific API on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for an API running in the Data Network. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn device-specific information, create tech support files in an isolated volume, and make limited configuration changes.

Bug ID(s): CSCvw55819 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw55819"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1396
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:
        Cisco Application Services Engine Software Release  First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities          1.1  1.1(3e)      2.0  Not vulnerable</cvrf:Note>
