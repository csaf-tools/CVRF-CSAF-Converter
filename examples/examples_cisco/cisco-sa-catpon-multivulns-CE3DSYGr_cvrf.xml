For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

Note: By default, the Cisco Catalyst PON Series Switches ONTs allow only local LAN connections to the web management interface. Therefore, all these vulnerabilities are exploitable only via the switchesâ€™ LAN ports unless Remote Web Management has been configured.

Devices must be running a vulnerable release and have the Telnet protocol enabled to be affected by the Cisco Catalyst PON Series Switches Optical Network Terminal Telnet Default Credential Vulnerability (CVE-2021-34795).

Note: The Telnet protocol is disabled by default and the default credential works only over Telnet.

Determine the Remote Web Management Configuration

To determine whether the Remote Web Management feature is enabled, navigate to Administration &gt; Device Access Settings and look at the Remote Web Management tab. If the Enable check box is checked, Remote Web Management is enabled on the device.

Determine the Telnet Configuration

To determine whether Telnet access is enabled on the device, navigate to Administration &gt; Device Access Settings and look at the Local Telnet tab. If the Enable check box is checked, Telnet access is enabled on the device.

Additional Information

For additional information, see Cisco Catalyst PON Series Switches ONT Configuration Guide - Manage Access ["https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst_pon/software/configuration_guide/ONT-Configuration-Guide/ONT-Configuration-Guide.pdf"].</cvrf:Note>
