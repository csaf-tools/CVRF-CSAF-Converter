  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the packet filtering features of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass L3 and L4 traffic filters.

The vulnerability is due to improper traffic filtering conditions on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious packet with specific characteristics and sending it to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the L3 and L4 traffic filters and inject an arbitrary packet into the network.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases 17.2.1r and later running in Controller mode. Cisco IOS XE Software releases earlier than the 17.2.1r release are not affected by this vulnerability because they do not include the SD-WAN feature.

At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software releases: 16.9.1 through 16.9.4, 16.10.1 through 16.10.5, 16.11.1a, and 16.12.2r through 16.12.4.

IMPORTANT: The standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN release images are separate from the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases. The SD-WAN feature set was first integrated into the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases starting with IOS XE Software Release 17.2.1r.
