  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-sb-rv-overflow-htpymMB5 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-sb-rv-overflow-htpymMB5"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers if they have UPnP configured:

RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewalls
RV130 VPN Routers
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Routers
RV215W Wireless-N VPN Routers

Note: The UPnP service is enabled by default on LAN interfaces and disabled by default on WAN interfaces. If UPnP is disabled on both the LAN and WAN interfaces, the device is not considered vulnerable.
  Determine the UPnP Configuration
To determine whether the UPnP feature is enabled on the LAN interface of a device, open the web-based management interface and navigate to Basic Settings &gt; UPnP. If the Disable check box is unchecked, UPnP is enabled on the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature.

To disable UPnP on the LAN interface of a device, do the following:

Open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings &gt; UPnP.
Check the Disable check box.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability described in this advisory. The Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:

End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers (selected models) ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-742771.pdf"]

Customers are encouraged to migrate to the Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.

When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that new devices will be sufficient for their network needs; the new devices contain sufficient memory, and current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
