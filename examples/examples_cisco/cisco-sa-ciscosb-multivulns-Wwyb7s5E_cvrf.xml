https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ciscosb-multivulns-Wwyb7s5E ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ciscosb-multivulns-Wwyb7s5E"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches if they are running firmware releases earlier than Release 1.2.0.6 and have the web-based management interface enabled. The web-based management interface is enabled through both HTTP and HTTPS by default.

Determine Whether the Web-Based Management Interface Is Enabled

To determine whether the web-based management interface is enabled through either HTTP or HTTPS, use the show running-config command on the device CLI. If both of the following lines are present in the configuration, the web-based management interface is disabled and the device is not affected:


no ip http server
no ip http secure server

Any other output indicates that the web-based management interface is enabled on the device.

In the web-based management interface, the HTTP Service and HTTPS Service are configured under Security &gt; TCP/UDP Service.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1542: Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Weak Session Management Vulnerability

A vulnerability in session management for the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication protections and gain unauthorized access to the interface. The attacker could obtain the privileges of the highjacked session account, which could include administrative privileges on the device.

This vulnerability is due to the use of weak session management for session identifier values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using reconnaissance methods to determine how to craft a valid session identifier. A successful exploit could allow the attacker take actions within the management interface with privileges up to the level of the administrative user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
