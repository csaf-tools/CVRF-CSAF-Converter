    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco DCNM releases earlier than Release 11.4(1).

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerabilities. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

CVE-2021-1133: Cisco Data Center Network Manager Path Traversal Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with a low-privilege account to conduct a path traversal attack on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the file system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvt82606 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt82606"]
CVE-ID: CVE-2021-1133
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2021-1255: Cisco Data Center Network Manager Path Traversal Vulnerability

A vulnerability in a certain REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a path traversal attack on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient path restriction enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or list arbitrary files on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvu28383 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28383"]
CVE-ID: CVE-2021-1255
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2021-1135: Cisco DCNM Software Configuration Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in a certain REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass security controls and modify default server configuration settings on the affected device.

The vulnerability is due to an incorrect comparison in a denylist implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted network traffic to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify server configuration settings on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvu28385 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28385"]
