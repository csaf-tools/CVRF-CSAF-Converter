    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view, modify, and delete data without proper authorization.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-authbypass-OHBPbxu ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-authbypass-OHBPbxu"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco DCNM releases earlier than Release 11.5(1).

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1270: Cisco DCNM Authorization Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the configuration without proper authorization.

This vulnerability is due to a failure to limit access to resources that are intended for users with Administrator privileges. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to edit the configuration. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid nonadministrative credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvv87627 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv87627"]
CVE-ID: CVE-2021-1270
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

CVE-2021-1269: Cisco DCNM Authorization Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization on an affected device and access sensitive information that is related to the device.

This vulnerability is due to a failure to limit access to resources that are intended for users with Administrator privileges. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to list, view, create, edit, and delete specific system configurations in the same manner as a user with Administrator privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
