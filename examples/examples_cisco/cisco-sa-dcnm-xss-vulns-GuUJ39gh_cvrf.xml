Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

CVE-2021-1249: Cisco DCNM Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2021-1286: Cisco DCNM Reflected File Download Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an RFD attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to click a link that submits malicious input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.
