  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured on the internal interfaces of the affected device.

There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-info-disclosure-vMJMMgJ ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-info-disclosure-vMJMMgJ"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ESA software releases 13.5.1 and earlier.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

In setups that do not involve Network Address Translation (NAT), enabling the Host header protection feature would prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. The following example shows how to use the adminaccessconfig command, followed by the HOSTHEADER operation, to enable the Host header protection feature:


mail.example.com&gt; adminaccessconfig
  Choose the operation you want to perform:    - BANNER - Configure login message (banner) for appliance administrator login.  - WELCOME - Configure welcome message (post login message) for appliance administrator login.  - IPACCESS - Configure IP-based access for appliance administrative interface.  - CSRF - Configure web UI Cross-Site Request Forgeries protection.  - XSS - Configure Cross-Site Scripting Attack protection.  - HOSTHEADER - Configure option to use host header in HTTP requests.  - TIMEOUT - Configure GUI and CLI session inactivity timeout.  - MAXHTTPHEADERFIELDSIZE - Configure maximum HTTP header Field size.  - HOW-TOS - Configure How-Tos feature.    []&gt; HOSTHEADER</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
