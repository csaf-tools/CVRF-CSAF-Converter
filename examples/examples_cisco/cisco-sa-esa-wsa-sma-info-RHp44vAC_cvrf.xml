  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the authentication for the general purpose APIs implementation of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access general system information and certain configuration information from an affected device.

The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ESA, Cisco SMA, and Cisco WSA if they supported general purpose API and the release was earlier than the first fixed release.

The general purpose API was first supported in the following Cisco software releases:

ESA Release 13.0
SMA Release 12.5
WSA Release 11.8
