    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower User Agent Software could allow an attacker to access a sensitive part of an affected system with a high-privileged account.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmcua-statcred-weeCcZct#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmcua-statcred-weeCcZct ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmcua-statcred-weeCcZct"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco FMC Software releases earlier than Release 6.5.0 if they had a Firepower User Agent Software release earlier than Release 2.5.0 enabled.

Note: This vulnerability also affected Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASAs) that were being managed by the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM). Customers are advised to upgrade to Cisco Firepower Services Release 6.5.0 or upgrade to Cisco FMC Software to manage ASAs.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine Whether Firepower User Agent Is Enabled

To determine whether Cisco Firepower User Agent is enabled, do the following from the web UI:

Choose System &gt; Integration &gt; Identity Sources.
Check whether User Agent is selected.
Confirm which IP addresses are configured to allow access to FMC.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in Cisco FMC Software and Cisco Firepower User Agent Software could allow an attacker to access a sensitive part of the system with a high-privileged account.


Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

Cisco Firepower Management Center Static Credential Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco FMC Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a sensitive part of an affected system with a high-privileged account.

This vulnerability is due to a system account that has a default and static password and that is not controlled by the system administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to user agent data. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative rights to control the device.

Bug ID(s): CSCvq50674 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq50674"]
CVE ID: CVE-2020-3318
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Cisco Firepower User Agent Static Credential Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Cisco Firepower User Agent software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access a sensitive part of an affected system with a high-privileged account.

This vulnerability is due to a system account that has a default and static password and is not controlled by the system administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to user agent data. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative rights to control the device.

Bug ID(s): CSCvo08211 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo08211"]
CVE ID: CVE-2020-3301
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that addresses this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
      Fixed Releases
At the time of publication, Cisco FMC Software releases 6.5.0 and later and Firepower User Agent Software releases 2.5.0 and later contained the fixes for these vulnerabilities.1 To address these vulnerabilities, customers must upgrade both Cisco FMC Software and Cisco Firepower User Agent Software.

Note: Customers who have ASAs that are managed by ASDMs are advised to upgrade to Cisco Firepower Services Release 6.5.0 or upgrade to Cisco FMC Software.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

1. Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
