    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow an attacker to conduct path traversal attacks and SQL injection attacks on an affected system. One of the SQL injection vulnerabilities that affects Unified CM IM&amp;P also affects Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) and could allow an attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-imp-trav-inj-dM687ZD6 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-imp-trav-inj-dM687ZD6"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected the following Cisco products:

Unified CM
Unified CM IM&amp;P
Unified CM SME

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

CVE-2021-1357: Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service Path Traversal Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CM IM&amp;P could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct path traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system.

The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-1355: Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service SQL Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CM IM&amp;P could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data that is stored in the underlying database, including hashed user credentials.
