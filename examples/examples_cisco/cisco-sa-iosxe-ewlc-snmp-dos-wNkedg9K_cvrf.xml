    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap generation for wireless clients of the Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap in relation to a wireless client connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, causing a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-ewlc-snmp-dos-wNkedg9K ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-ewlc-snmp-dos-wNkedg9K"]

This advisory is part of the September 24, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 34 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74268"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family if the device is running a vulnerable release and is configured to send SNMP traps for 802.1x wireless connections. The following hardware platforms are vulnerable:

Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches
Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers
Embedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst 9100 Access Points

For more information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine Whether a Device Is configured for SNMP trapflags for 802.1x
To determine whether any SNMP trapflags for 802.1x clients are enabled for a device, log in to the device and use the show running-config | include trapflags client dot11 command on the CLI to check for the presence of any command in the form trapflags client dot11 in the global configuration. If any output is returned then the device is vulnerable. This vulnerability is specific to the 802.1x SNMP traps, which are indicated by the dot11 in the CLI command output.

The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include trapflags client dot11 command for a device that has SNMP trapflags configured:


Router# show running-config | include trapflags client dot11
trapflags client dot11 assocfail
trapflags client dot11 associate
trapflags client dot11 authenticate
trapflags client dot11  authfail
trapflags client dot11 deauthenticate
trapflags client dot11 disassociate</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco software:

IOS Software
IOS XR Software
NX-OS Software
WLC Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

The workaround for this vulnerability is to remove all commands from the running configuration of the form trapflags client dot11. These commands cause an SNMP trap to be generated for specific states of the wireless connection to the device, and that SNMP trap generation function causes the device to be vulnerable. If the wireless network does not require SNMP traps, it is considered a valid workaround to remove these commands.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).

Customers can use the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to search advisories in the following ways:

Choose the software and one or more releases
Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases
Enter the output of the show version command

After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.

Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:



By default, the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.

For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.</cvrf:Note>
