  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Microsoft Active Directory integration of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a valid administrator account on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect privilege assignment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system with a crafted Active Directory account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root privileges on an affected device.

Note: Only devices that have the CLI configured to support Active Directory authentication are affected by this vulnerability. CLI support for Active Directory authentication is disabled by default. All other uses of Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Certificate Services within ISE are not affected.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-priv-esc-fNZX8hHj ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-priv-esc-fNZX8hHj"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE releases 2.6 and 2.7.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco ISE releases 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.3, and 2.4 because the CLI Active Directory capability did not exist in those releases.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">In order for exploitation to occur, a user with administrator access to the CLI must do both of the following:

Enable the Active Directory CLI capability.
Enable the Active Directory CLI authentication capability (disabled by default) with knowledge of an existing Active Directory domain.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

However, administrators can disable the Active Directory CLI capability as a mitigation.

Note: A user with administrator access to the CLI will be able to re-enable it.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
      Fixed Releases
At the time of publication, Cisco ISE releases 2.6 Patch 9 and later, 2.7 Patch 3 and later, and releases 3.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.

Important: Cisco ISE 3.0 is a smart licensing-only solution that requires communication to the cloud. Cisco ISE 3.0 does not support air-gapped networks until Release 3.0 Patch 2.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
