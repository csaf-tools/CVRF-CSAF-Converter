    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ISE Software.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:
  CVE-2021-34738: Cisco ISE Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web-based management interface on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to upload a file that contains a malicious payload to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvy81868
CVE ID: CVE-2021-34738
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    CVE-2021-40121: Cisco ISE Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
