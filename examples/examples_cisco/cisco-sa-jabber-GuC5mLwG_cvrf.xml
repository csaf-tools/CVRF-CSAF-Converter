    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber for Windows, Cisco Jabber for Mac, and Cisco Jabber for mobile platforms could allow an attacker to access sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-GuC5mLwG ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-GuC5mLwG"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Jabber releases earlier than Release 14.0.1.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco Jabber client software that is configured for either of the following modes:

Phone-only mode
Team Messaging mode</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker must be:

Authenticated to an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) server that the affected software is using
Able to send XMPP messages to an affected system

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1569: Cisco Jabber for Windows Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of message content. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) messages to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to return sensitive authentication information to another system, which the attacker could use in further attacks.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvy20799 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy20799"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1569
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2021-1570: Cisco Jabber Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows, Cisco Jabber for Mac, and Cisco Jabber for mobile platforms could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of message content. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
