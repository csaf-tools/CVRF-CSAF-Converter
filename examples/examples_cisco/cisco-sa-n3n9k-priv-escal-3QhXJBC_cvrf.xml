    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Enable Secret feature of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to issue the enable command and get full administrative privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials for the affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the enable command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing the enable command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full administrative privileges without using the enable password.

Note: The Enable Secret feature is disabled by default.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC"]

This advisory is part of the August 2020 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes seven Cisco Security Advisories that describe seven vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: August 2020 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74239"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have the feature privilege command and the enable secret command configured:

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:
Firepower 1000 Series
Firepower 2100 Series

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The enable secret command was added to Cisco NX-OS Software as a tool for migrating configurations from Cisco IOS Software to Cisco NX-OS Software only. The command serves no other purpose in Cisco NX-OS Software and should otherwise be disabled. The enable secret command will be removed in future releases.

The enable secret command is used in Cisco IOS Software to set a password that grants a user privileged administrative access to a Cisco IOS Software system. In Cisco NX-OS Software, there is no concept of an enable-secret or enable-password setting. Privileges are managed using role-based access control (RBAC). The functional equivalent to enabling mode access on a Cisco IOS Software device is assignment of an account to the network-admin (global privileged access) or vdc-admin (virtual device context [VDC]-specific privileged access) role in Cisco NX-OS Software.

For additional information, see the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="5">To determine whether this vulnerability has been exploited, use the show accounting log | include "enable" command. The following example shows the output of this command after a low-privileged user has elevated their privilege by using the enable command:


nxos# show accounting log | include "enable"
type=update:id=console0:user=guest:cmd=enable (SUCCESS)
type=update:id=console0:user=guest:cmd=enable 15 (SUCCESS)</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

Cisco NX-OS Software uses RBAC to manage user accounts and privileges. For guidance, see the Configuring User Accounts and RBAC ["https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_1/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/sec_rbac.html"] section of the Cisco NX-OS Security Configuration Guide.

Once RBAC is configured, remove the enable secret command from the configuration.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Cisco NX-OS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).

Customers can use the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to search advisories in the following ways:

Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases
Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases
Enter the output of the show version command

After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.

Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:
    Cisco NX-OS Software  Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode    MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches  Nexus 1000V Series Switches  Nexus 3000 Series Switches  Nexus 5000 Series Switches  Nexus 6000 Series Switches  Nexus 7000 Series Switches  Nexus 9000 Series Switches




By default, the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.
