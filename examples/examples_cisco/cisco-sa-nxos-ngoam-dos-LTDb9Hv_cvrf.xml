    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the VXLAN Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software, known as NGOAM, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific packets with a Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) OAM EtherType. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets, including the TRILL OAM EtherType of 0x8902, to a device that is part of a VXLAN Ethernet VPN (EVPN) fabric. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to experience high CPU usage and consume excessive system resources, which may result in overall control plane instability and cause the affected device to reload.

Note: The NGOAM feature is disabled by default.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software, they have the NGOAM feature enabled, and they are configured with a virtual port channel (vPC) peer:

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine the Status of the NGOAM Feature
To determine whether an affected device is configured with the NGOAM feature enabled, use the show feature | include ngoam command at the Cisco NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled. The following example shows the NGOAM feature enabled on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software:


nxos# show feature | include ngoam
ngoam               1          enabled
  Determine the Status of vPC
To determine whether an affected device is configured with a vPC peer, use the show vpc brief command at the Cisco NX-OS CLI. The following example shows the output from a device with an active vPC peer:


nxos# show vpc brief
Legend:
(*) - local vPC is down, forwarding via vPC peer-link

vPC domain id                     : 10

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Firepower 1000 Series
Firepower 2100 Series
Firepower 4100 Series
Firepower 9300 Security Appliances
MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches
Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The NGOAM feature provides diagnostic capabilities for VXLAN networks, including ping, pathtrace, and traceroute messages. Some of these messages may include a special OAM header that is identified by EtherType 0x8902, which is defined for TRILL OAM in RFC 7455.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific packets that include this EtherType. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that include the TRILL OAM EtherType to a device that is part of a VXLAN EVPN fabric. The attacker must either be adjacent to a Virtual Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP) or have access to the underlay of the VXLAN EVPN to exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability may cause any VTEP device with NGOAM enabled and an active vPC peer to unexpectedly perform Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) protocol synchronizations with the peer. This may lead to high CPU usage and excessive consumption of system resources, which may result in overall control plane instability and an eventual reload of the affected devices. The NGOAM feature is disabled by default.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

However, disabling the NGOAM feature removes the exploit vector. Administrators can disable the NGOAM feature by using the no feature ngoam command  at the Cisco NX-OS CLI in global configuration mode. This action may be a suitable mitigation for affected devices that do not require use of this feature until they can be upgraded.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
        Cisco NX-OS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).

Customers can use the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] to search advisories in the following ways:

Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases
Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases
Enter the output of the show version command

After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.

Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:
    Cisco NX-OS Software  Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode    MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches  Nexus 1000V Series Switches  Nexus 3000 Series Switches  Nexus 5000 Series Switches  Nexus 6000 Series Switches  Nexus 7000 Series Switches  Nexus 9000 Series Switches




By default, the Cisco Software Checker ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

However, disabling the NGOAM feature removes the exploit vector. Administrators can disable the NGOAM feature by using the no feature ngoam command  at the Cisco NX-OS CLI in global configuration mode. This action may be a suitable mitigation for affected devices that do not require use of this feature until they can be upgraded.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</Description>
