  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Web Access feature of Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper access controls on the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the device, which could allow the attacker to bypass access restrictions. A successful attack could allow the attacker to view sensitive information, including device call logs that contain names, usernames, and phone numbers of users of the device.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco IP Phones if they were running firmware that was compatible with Cisco Unified Communications Manager releases 12.8(1) and earlier and had the Web Access feature enabled:

6900 Series
7800 Series
7900 Series
8800 Series
8900 Series
9900 Series

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Phone (MPP) Firmware.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Web Access feature for Cisco IP Phones allows configuration and logging information to be collected for the purposes of troubleshooting and auditing. However, when enabled, the feature may expose potentially sensitive information that is in the device logs and that could be collected by malicious users.

If the Web Access feature must be used, administrators are advised to consider disabling the feature after troubleshooting is complete.

To implement the Web Access Disable process, which would prevent access to the serviceability application that exposes this vulnerability, see the Security Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager. ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/security/12_5_1/cucm_b_security-guide-1251/cucm_b_security-guide-1251_chapter_01110.html"]

For best practices and hardening measures to protect devices that are deployed on premises, see the Preferred Architecture for Cisco Collaboration 12.x Enterprise On-Premises Deployments, CVD ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Collaboration/enterprise/12x/120/collbcvd/security.html#pgfId-1080263"] guide.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
