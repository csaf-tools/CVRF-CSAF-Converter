    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges.

These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-command-inject-BY4c5zd ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-command-inject-BY4c5zd"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business routers and firmware releases:
    Product Firmware Release     RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers 4.2.3.14 and earlier   RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers 4.2.3.14 and earlier   RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers 4.2.3.14 and earlier   RV082 Dual WAN VPN Routers 4.2.3.14 and earlier   RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers 1.5.1.11 and earlier   RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers 1.5.1.11 and earlier
The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for these devices.
 Determine the Device Configuration
To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
 Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
   Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers Firmware Release 1.5.1.13.

Cisco has not released and will not release firmware updates for the Cisco RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers to address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. These products have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:

End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-736069.html"]
End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV042 and RV042G VPN Router (all models) ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-743070.html"]
End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-739364.html"]

Customers who are running Cisco RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers are encouraged to migrate to the Cisco Small Business RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router.

When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the new device will be sufficient for their network needs, that new devices contain sufficient memory, and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco TAC or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
