    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) as a restricted user.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-osinj-rce-pwTkPCJv ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-osinj-rce-pwTkPCJv"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business Routers if they are running Firmware Release 1.0.03.19 or earlier:

RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Router

The web-based management interface for these devices is available through local LAN connections by default and cannot be disabled there. The interface can also be made available through the WAN interface by enabling the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on affected devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface through a local LAN connection and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:

RV160 VPN Router
RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV260 VPN Router</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one vulnerability is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-ID: CVE-2020-3451
Bug ID(s): CSCvu40103 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu40103"]
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily degrade the performance of the interface process or execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-ID: CVE-2020-3453
Bug ID(s): CSCvu49391 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu49391"]
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers firmware releases 1.0.03.20 and later.</cvrf:Note>
