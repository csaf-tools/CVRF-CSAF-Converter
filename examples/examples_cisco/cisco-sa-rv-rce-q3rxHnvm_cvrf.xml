    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-q3rxHnvm ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-q3rxHnvm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers:

RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
RV130 VPN Router
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router
  Determine the Device Configuration
The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability described in this advisory.
