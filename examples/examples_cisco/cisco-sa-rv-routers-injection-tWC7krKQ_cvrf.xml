    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-injection-tWC7krKQ ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-injection-tWC7krKQ"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:
    Product Cisco Bug IDs Vulnerable Releases Fixed Releases     Cisco Small Business RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall CSCvt28218, CSCvt28233 1.2.2.5 and earlier 1.2.2.8 and later   Cisco Small Business RV130 VPN Router CSCvt28203, CSCvt28229 1.0.3.54 and earlier 1.0.3.55 and later   Cisco Small Business RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router CSCvt28203, CSCvt28229 1.0.3.54 and earlier 1.0.3.55 and later   Cisco Small Business RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router CSCvt28223, CSCvt28237 1.3.1.5 and earlier 1.3.1.7 and later
The web-based management interface for these devices is available through a local LAN connection or through the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface though a local LAN connection and then choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

Cisco Small Business Routers Command Injection Vulnerability

The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative privileges sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.

Bug ID(s): CSCvt28203, CSCvt28218, CSCvt28223
CVE ID: CVE-2020-3268
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.2
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Cisco Small Business Routers Stack Overflow Vulnerability

The vulnerability is due to improper boundary restrictions of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.

Bug ID(s): CSCvt28229, CSCvt28233, CSCvt28237
CVE ID: CVE-2020-3269
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.2
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Series Routers firmware releases 1.0.3.6 and later, 1.2.2.8 and later, and 1.3.1.7 and later.</cvrf:Note>
