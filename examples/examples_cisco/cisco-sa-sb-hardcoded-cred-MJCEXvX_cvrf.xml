    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-hardcoded-cred-MJCEXvX ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-hardcoded-cred-MJCEXvX"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches if they were running a vulnerable firmware release and had the web-based management interface enabled. The web-based management interface is enabled through both HTTP and HTTPS by default.

Determine the Device Configuration

To determine whether the web-based management interface is enabled through either HTTP or HTTPS, use the show running-config command on the device CLI. If both of the following lines are present in the configuration, the web-based management interface is disabled and the device is not affected:


no ip http server
no ip http secure server

Any other output indicates that the web-based management interface is enabled on the device.

In the web-based management interface, the HTTP service and HTTPS service are configured under Security &gt; TCP/UDP Service.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-34757: Cisco Business 220 Series Static Password Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to obtain higher privileges on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to the use of a static password in all Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware. An attacker with Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a serial interface and accessing encoded passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain and reconfigure user account passwords.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvy90709 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy90709"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-34757
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2021-34744: Cisco Business 220 Series Static Key Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to the use of a static cryptographic key in all Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware images. An attacker with Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface and accessing encrypted passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive login credentials for other applications.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
