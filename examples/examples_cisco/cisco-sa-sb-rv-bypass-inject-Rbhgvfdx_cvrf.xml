  Determine the Device Configuration
The web-based management interface for these devices is available through local LAN connections by default and cannot be disabled there. The interface can also be made available through the WAN interface by enabling the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on affected devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface through a local LAN connection and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1473: Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:

RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Router

Bug ID(s): CSCvw92538 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw92538"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1473
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2021-1472: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Authentication Bypass File Upload Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and upload files to directories that should require administrative authentication.

This vulnerability is due to improper session management on affected devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to directories that should have been restricted. It should be noted that the files are uploaded to temporary directories, and the files should be deleted.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:

RV160 VPN Router
RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV260 VPN Router
RV260P VPN Router with PoE
RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router
RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Router

Bug ID(s): CSCvw92718 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw92718"] and CSCvw92723 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw92723"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1472
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed firmware release as indicated in the following table(s):
        Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers  Fixed Releases          RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W  1.0.01.03 and later      RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P  1.0.03.21 and later
