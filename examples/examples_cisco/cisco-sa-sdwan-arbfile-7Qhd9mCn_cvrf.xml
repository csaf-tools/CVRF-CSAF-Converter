  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the underlying file system of an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the user-supplied input parameters of a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content in any arbitrary files that reside on the underlying host file system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
