    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco SD-WAN Software:

IOS XE SD-WAN Software
SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software
SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers
SD-WAN vEdge Routers
SD-WAN vManage Software
SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1300: Cisco SD-WAN Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of IP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP traffic through an affected device, which may cause a buffer overflow when the traffic is processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvt11525 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt11525"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1300
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2021-1301: Cisco SD-WAN Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the NETCONF subsystem of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device or system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied input that is read by the system during the establishment of an SSH connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file to be read by the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could result in a DoS condition on the affected device or system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvi69895 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/"]

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s). To ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:
