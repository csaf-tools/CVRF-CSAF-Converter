  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open (TFO) when used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file policy for HTTP.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
  Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0
For Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0, as a workaround when the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled, an administrator may enable built-in rule 129:2 in the intrusion policy and set the action to Drop instead of Alert.

Use the following steps to verify that the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled. For more details, see the Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3 ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/670/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-670/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#id_120089"] section of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.7.

Log in to the Admin Portal for the FTD deployment.
Navigate to Policies &gt; Intrusion.
Look for the Snort Version line above the table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.

Use the following steps to enable rule 129:2. For more details, see the Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3) ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/670/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-670/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_54aef253-02ab-4044-88ea-cea05249686d"] section of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.7.

Log in to the Admin Portal for the FTD deployment.
Navigate to Policies &gt; Intrusion.
Choose any system-provided policy, such as Balanced Security and Connectivity.
Search for rule 129:2.
Check the check box next to the rule to enable it.
Choose Drop from the Action drop-down list.
Add the intrusion policy to a rule in Access control policy.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

        <Description>While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
  Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0
For Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0, as a workaround when the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled, an administrator may enable built-in rule 129:2 in the intrusion policy and set the action to Drop instead of Alert.

Use the following steps to verify that the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled. For more details, see the Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3 ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/670/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-670/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#id_120089"] section of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.7.
