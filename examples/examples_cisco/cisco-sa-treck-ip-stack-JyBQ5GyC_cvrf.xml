    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A set of previously unknown vulnerabilities on the Treck IP stack implementation were disclosed on June 16, 2020. The vulnerabilities are collectively known as Ripple20. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in remote code execution, denial of service (DoS), or information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-treck-ip-stack-JyBQ5GyC ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-treck-ip-stack-JyBQ5GyC"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.

The Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

Any product or service not listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details. Unless otherwise documented, all software releases prior to the first fixed release are to be considered affected by these vulnerabilities.
