    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the way Cisco UCS Manager software handles SSH sessions could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper resource management for established SSH sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of SSH sessions on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and restart of internal Cisco UCS Manager software processes and a temporary loss of access to the Cisco UCS Manager CLI and web UI.

Note: The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
