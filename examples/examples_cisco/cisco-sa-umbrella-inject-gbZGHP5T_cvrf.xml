    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Admin audit log export feature and Scheduled Reports feature of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform formula and link injection attacks on an affected device.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Umbrella, which is cloud based.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

CVE-2021-1474: Cisco Umbrella CSV Formula Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Admin audit log export feature of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a formula injection attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of formula elements in the comma-separated value (CSV) file that is generated by the Admin audit log export feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing certain actions that would lead to an injection of malicious entries into the log. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject malicious formula elements into the CSV file. These elements would be executed when a user opens the CSV file with a spreadsheet application, which could lead to manipulation of the data in the CSV file or code execution on the computer of the user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvx27753 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx27753"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1474
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2021-1475: Cisco Umbrella Link Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Scheduled Reports feature of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a link injection attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by scheduling a report with a crafted title. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject a malicious link into the report, leading the user to believe that the link is coming from the application.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
