    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on an affected system.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-YuTVWqy ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-YuTVWqy"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:

IOS XE SD-WAN Software
SD-WAN cEdge Routers
SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software
SD-WAN vEdge Routers
SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2021-1479: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Remote Management Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

A vulnerability in a remote management component of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the vulnerable component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted connection request to the vulnerable component that, when processed, could cause a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvv87918 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv87918"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1479
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Critical
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2021-1137: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the user management function of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on the underlying operating system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the affected software. An authenticated attacker who has permissions to add new users or groups on the vManage system could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvw08533 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw08533"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1137
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2021-1480: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in system file transfer functions of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on the underlying operating system.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to the system file transfer functions. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and modify the system in such a way that could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvw31395 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw31395"] and CSCvs98509 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvs98509"]
CVE ID: CVE-2021-1480
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 7.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table.
        Cisco SD-WAN vManage Release  First Fixed Release  First Fixed Release for all Vulnerabilities in this Advisory          18.4 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.
