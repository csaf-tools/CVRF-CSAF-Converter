    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24 ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following releases of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:

Cisco Webex Meetings: All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player releases earlier than the first fixed release
Cisco Webex Meetings Server: All Webex Network Recording Player releases earlier than the first fixed release

To determine which release of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or Cisco Webex Player is installed on a system, open the player and choose Help &gt; About.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Webex Meetings is a hosted, multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.

Cisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.

Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Meetings sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from a user’s Cisco Webex website download page in Classic view, or from the Cisco Webex Video Recording ["https://www.webex.com/video-recording.html"] page.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:
        Cisco Webex Platform  First Fixed Release          Webex Meetings 40.6.x sites  40.6.11      Webex Meetings sites  40.8.0      Webex Meetings Server 3.x  3.0MR3 SP4      Webex Meetings Server 4.x  4.0MR3 SP3
Note: Bug ID CSCvu59610 (CVE-2020-3604) affects only Cisco Webex Meetings 40.6.x and 40.7.x sites and earlier. No other products or code trains are affected.</cvrf:Note>
